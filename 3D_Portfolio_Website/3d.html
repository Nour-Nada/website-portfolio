                    A short 3D running sequence made for pwnisher's Kinetic Rush community render challenge.
                    The entire animation was created in Blender and conceived by me.
                    Due to hardware limitations the render is a bit flickry and some imperfections could not be fixed.
                    Color grading was done in DaVinci Resolve.
                    Assets were used from KitBash3d and other online sources

                    A realistic 3D render made in Blender attempting to capture the tranquility of lush green gardens.
                    For final touchups and color grading DaVinci Resolve was used.
                    In this render I utilized vegetation addons and photoscans.

                    A Black and White Realistic 3D render made in Blender of a floating buoy lost at sea.
                    The black and white effect was achieved through changing the view transform and then doing some final touchups and color grading done in DaVinci Resolve to complete the look.
