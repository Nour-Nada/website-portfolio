                    I designed, conceived, and rendered the full house in Revit.
                    Renders, elevations, floor plans, and schedules were all created and compiled to make a plan set.
                    This 10,000sq ft house consists of two stories, an outdoor area, a pool, and a garage.
                    Its design is meant to be for cliff side locations, that is spacious and allows panoramic views of the landscape.
